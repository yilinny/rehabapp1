#Gamified Rehab 

A webapplication with a selection of arcade games designed for neuro-rehabilitation. Different aspects of each game can be adjusted to make the 'just-right' challenge, allowing it to compensate for a range of visual, motor and cognitive deficits in clients with brain injury. Games also reward users with coins, encouraging self-driven engagement with injury. Stats are collected to allow clinicians to track: engagement, performance, and link into users' real-life goals.
